Step 1: Loading the Image

1. The code sets the src attribute of the Image object (downloadImgSrc) to the specified image URL (userImageLink).
2. The browser starts loading the image from the specified URL.

Step 2: Recording the Start Time

1. Before loading the image, the code records the current time in milliseconds using new Date().getTime() and stores it in the time_start variable.

Step 3: Waiting for the Image to Load

1. The code sets an onload event handler for the Image object (downloadImgSrc).
2. When the image finishes loading, the onload event is triggered, and the code inside the event handler is executed.

Step 4: Recording the End Time

1. Inside the onload event handler, the code records the current time in milliseconds using new Date().getTime() and stores it in the end_time variable.

Step 5: Calculating the Time Duration

1. The code calculates the time duration by subtracting the start time (time_start) from the end time (end_time) and dividing the result by 1000 to convert milliseconds to seconds.

Step 6: Calculating the Internet Speed

1. The code calculates the total number of bits loaded (by multiplying the image size in bytes by 8).
2. It then calculates the internet speed in bits per second (bps) by dividing the total number of bits loaded by the time duration.
3. The code converts the speed from bps to kilobits per second (kbps) and megabits per second (Mbps) by dividing by 1024.

Step 7: Displaying the Results

1. Finally, the code displays the calculated internet speed in bps, kbps, and Mbps using an alert box.

By following these steps, the code estimates the user's internet connection speed by measuring the time it takes to load a specific image.
